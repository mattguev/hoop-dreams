# Fantasy Basketball Game Predictor

## Motivation
Idea: Fantasy Basketball lets players act as general managers building their team from a pool of current NBA players, and competing every week over the course of the real NBA season to see whose team can produce a better statistical output.

The style of Fantasy Basketball above--the one I play most often--is called 9 Categories, Head-to-Head. Its defining features:
  - The season begins with managers taking turns to select anywhere from 10-16 players (draft position is decided randomly).
  - Every week, managers are selected in pairs to compete against one another.
  - Managers compete to win 9 categories (Field Goal %, Free Throw %, 3-Pointers Made, Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Turnovers).
  - You win each category (except for Turnovers) if your players produce more of that statistic than your opponent's players by the end of the week.
  - Winning each category is worth 1 point. A tie results in no points for either manager.
  - Managers can replace their players with any current active NBA player ('Free Agents'). 
  
  For example, players with limited resources can still develop a competitive advantage by focusing on 5 key categories at the cost of the other 4. This  is a large competitive advantage to be had in  Visualizations and advanced statistics are locked behind a premium subscription

  
## Audience and Features
Solution: Build a program that unlocks a premium feature like basic matchup analysis--comparing two teams' expected statistical outputs and declaring the likely winner.
